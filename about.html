            <p>
                i'm xleepree<br />people usually call me "diego" because that's
                my name<br /><small
                    >xleepree is such a dumb name and i wish i went by something
                    else</small
                ><br />i play portal, gd, terraria, subnautica, and teardown<br /><small
                    >and roblox, but very rarely</small
                ><br />i also do custom portal 2 maps in the valve hammer editor
                and html css (this website)<br />i also know a very very small
                bit of lua or <i>"luau"</i> in roblox's case<br />i really like
                creative writing and i've written like 20 chapter
                stories/narratives only to trash them because i thought they
                were a bad or whatever<br />the running joke (i think) in my
                friend group about me is that i'm a gay moron because i once
                said over 2 years ago "hey i have a lot of boy friends" except i
                accidentally didn't put a space between "boy" and "friends"<br />nobody
                will shut up about it to this day and i don't blame them, it's
                pretty funny<br />unfortuantely, however, i'm the one being
                ridiculed<br />i can't get over how dumb my online name is<br />like
                c'mon<br /><i>Xleepree?</i><br />sounds like something that
                would come up with by just smashing keys<br /><small
                    >(that's what actually happened)</small
                ><br />it's also inpronouncable, i have no idea how to pronounce
                it myself<br />i should come up with something new but i dunno
