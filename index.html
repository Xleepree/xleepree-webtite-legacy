      <h2>welcome</h2>
      <p>welcome to my incredibly basic website i made with my severe and <b>SIGNIFICANT</b> lack of critical thinking</p>
      <p>you may be thinking,</p>
      <p><i>Why did you make this website?<br>Why is this website so UGLY?<br>What's the point of this?</i></p>
      <p>and my answer to that is<br>-My friend made one (you can visit it at <b>taxevaiden.pages.dev</b>) and I was like "Huh, maybe I could do that stuff"<br>-I'm lazy, and this website is also a work in progress as you may have already seen<br>-I don't know</p>
      <h2>notes</h2>
      <p>-if you couldn't already tell, this website is a work in progress. the blog and projects page are EMPTY<br>-this website has not been designed to be mobile friendly in any way- at best you could view this on a tablet</p>
