                i'm xleepree<br />people usually call me "diego" because that's
                my name<br />
                <small>xleepree is such a dumb name and i wish i went by something
                else</small><br />
            </p>

            <p>
                i play portal, gd, terraria, subnautica, and teardown<br />
                <small>and roblox, but very rarely</small>
            </p>

            <p>
                i also do custom portal 2 maps in the valve hammer editor
                and html css (this website)<br />i know a very very small
                bit of lua or <i>"luau"</i> in roblox's case
            </p>

            <p>
                i really like creative writing and i've written like 20 chapter
                stories/narratives only to trash them because i thought they
                were bad or whatever
            </p>    
                
            <p>
                the running joke (i think) in my
                friend group about me is that i'm a gay moron because i once
                said over 2 years ago "hey i have a lot of boy friends" except i
                accidentally didn't put a space between "boy" and "friends"<br>
                it's understandable, i guess..<br>
                <small>i am sick and tired of it but it's not like they'll care ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</small>
            </p>  
                
            <p>   
                i can't get over how dumb my online name is<br />like
                c'mon<br /><i>Xleepree?</i><br />sounds like something that
                would come up with by just smashing keys<br /><small
                    >(that's what actually happened)</small
                ><br />it's also inpronouncable, i have no idea how to pronounce
                it myself<br />i should come up with something new but i dunno
            </p>
